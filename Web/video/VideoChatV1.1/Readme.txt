This sample project contains 3 files
1. this readme file
2. default.html
3. User.html
When you want to test the project you should run it on HTTPS or localhost, otherwise webrtc will not work.
The default.html is the opening page. It makes an Ajax request to the API and creates a new room and returns credentials.
User.html is a complete working video chat example. The only thing you should pass to it is ChatGuid and UserGuid which you generate with our API.
